# 🏨 Hostel Management System - MERN Stack Project

A full-stack web application for hostel leave and outing management, developed using the **MERN** stack. The system features two portals — one for **students** to submit requests and another for **supervisors** to review, approve, or reject those requests. Designed for efficiency, clarity, and ease of use.
